# Wine Quality Prediction
Linear Regression for Red and White Wine Quality

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Red Wine Quality Dataset**, available on Kaggle: [Red Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009). The dataset contains 1,599 samples of red wine and includes 11 features related to the wineâ€™s chemical composition, such as:

- **Fixed Acidity**: Acidity that does not evaporate.
- **Volatile Acidity**: Acidity that can evaporate during the fermentation process.
- **Citric Acid**: An organic acid found in wines.
- **Residual Sugar**: The amount of sugar left after fermentation.
- **Chlorides**: The amount of salt in the wine.
- **Free Sulfur Dioxide**: The free form of SO2 that protects wine from spoilage.
- **Total Sulfur Dioxide**: The total amount of SO2 in the wine.
- **Density**: The density of the wine, which can be influenced by the alcohol content.
- **pH**: The measure of acidity or basicity of the wine.
- **Sulphates**: Additives that can contribute to wine stability.
- **Alcohol**: The percentage of alcohol content in the wine.

The target variable is the **quality** of the wine, which is a subjective rating given by experts on a scale from 0 to 10. Sadly, the performance multiclass classification models is still not acceptable, these models are still in developing progress.

In the meantime, I created a new binary label where quality from 6.5 upward is deemed good wine and the rest is bad wine. I then use **Decision Tree** model to perform the prediction. The performance is evaluated using ROC and Area under the curve
